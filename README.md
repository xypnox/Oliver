The modern font made by someone who has no real knowledge of typography and font design. The font was made because I had to make it. No other reason springs to my mind.

The font is what I would consider a geometric beauty with a little bit of attitude.

The font was derived from [Aileron](https://dotcolon.net/font/aileron/).
